## Hobbe's & Game Theory


## Game theory, rationality and evolution of the social contract

Skyrms, B. 2000

Game theory based on rational choice is compared with game theory based on evolutionary, or other adaptive, dynamics. The Nash equilibrium concept has a central role to play in both theories, even though one makes extremely strong assumptions about cognitive capacities and common knowledge of the players, and the other does not. Nevertheless, there are also important differences between the two theories. These differences are illustrated in a number of games that model types of interaction that are key ingredients for any theory of the social contract. 

## Game Theory, Rationality and Evolution

Skyrms 1997

The Theory of Games was conceived as a theory of interactive decisions for rational agents. The basic solution concept — that of Nash equilibrium — is built on rationality assumptions whose strength has only recently been made explicit. Refinements of Nash equilibrium, such as subgame perfection, require even stronger rationality assumptions. Here, it seems, is the pure domain of rational choice theory, where rational decision makers reflect on each others rational decisions, and rationality assumptions are multiplied by strategic interaction

### Reflections on Ethics and Game Theory

Applications of game theory to moral philosophy are impeded by founda- tional issues and troublesome examples. In the first part of this paper, questions are raised about the appropriate game-theoretical frameworks for applications to moral philosophy and about the proper interpretations of the theoretical devices employed in these frame- works. In the second part, five examples that should be of particular interest to those interested in the connections between ethics and game theory are delineated and discussed. The first example comprises games in which there is an outcome unanimously preferred to the “solution” of the game, appropriately defined. The second comprises games whose solution calls for different players to employ different strategies. The third comprises games whose solution calls for players to adopt mixed strategies. The fourth comprises games whose solution requires players to cycle among a variety of strategies. The fifth comprises games whose solution requires players to discriminate in morally inappropriate ways.

### Agent-Based Simulation in the Study of Social Dilemmas

Artificial Intelligence Review
Volume 19 Issue 1, March 2003
Pages 3 - 92

This review discusses agent-based social simulation (ABSS) in relation to the study of social dilemmas such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and Tragedy of the Commons. Its aims are to explore the place of ABSS in relation to other research methods such as mathematical analysis, to familiarise artificial intelligence researchers (particularly those working on multi-agent systems) with a body of relevant multidisciplinary work, and to suggest directions for future ABSS research on social dilemmas.

ABSS research can contribute greatly to the understanding of social phenomena, but needs to be based on a clear appreciation of the current `state of play' in the areas where it is used. With regard to `thin' (simple, general) simulation models, this primarily means attending to what has been or could be discovered by mathematical analysis, to work using other forms of simulation, and to the relevant theoretical disputes; with regard to `thick' (specific, detailed) models (about which the paper has less to say), linking to the relevant `thin' models and to the empirical evidence. The bulk of ABSS work on social dilemmas has been concentrated in quite a narrow – though certainly significant – area (reciprocal altruism in the Prisoner's Dilemma), and has sometimes been seriously flawed by over-ambitious claims, and insufficient attention to analytical approaches – although this same work has been very fertile in terms of inspiring further work, both analytical and simulation-based.


### Computational models of collective behavior

doi:10.1016/j.tics.2005.07.009

Computational models of human collective behavior offer promise in providing quantitative and empirically verifiable accounts of how individual decisions lead to the emergence of group-level organizations. Agent-based models (ABMs) describe interactions among individual agents and their environment, and provide a process-oriented alternative to descriptive mathematical models. Recent ABMs provide compelling accounts of group pattern formation, contagion and cooperation, and can be used to predict, manipulate and improve upon collective behavior. ABMs overcome an assumption that underlies much of cognitive science – that the individual is the crucial unit of cognition. The alternative advocated here is that individuals participate in collective organizations that they might not understand or even perceive, and that these organizations affect and are affected by individual behavior.


### Evolutionary games and morality

Krebs 2000

The implications of game theory models of the evolution of strategies of exchange are explored with respect to the evolution of moral dispositions. I argue that dispositions to practice tit for tat strategies could have evolved, but the moral behaviours to which they give rise do not fare well on criteria of morality. Inasmuch as the strategy implicit in the Golden Rule is unconditional, it could not have evolved in environments containing strategies that exploit it. However, dispositions to invoke conditional principles such as those that prescribe that people cooperate with those they observe cooperating and shun those they observe behaving selfishly, could have been selected in some conditions and may have given rise to the evolution of indirect reciprocity. The key to the evolution of morality is discrimination in favour of cooperators and against cheaters and selfish individualists. The limitations of game theory in the explanation of human morality are acknowledged. 


### Exploring cooperation and competition using agent-based modeling

Agent-based modeling enhances our capacity to model competitive and cooperative behaviors at both the individual and group levels of analysis. Models presented in these proceedings produce consistent results regarding the relative fragility of cooperative regimes among agents operating under diverse rules. These studies also show how competition and cooperation may generate change at both the group and societal level. Agent-based simulation of competitive and cooperative behaviors may reveal the greatest payoff to social science research of all agent-based modeling efforts because of the need to better understand the dynamics of these behaviors in an increasingly interconnected world.

### The evolution of cooperation in hostile environments

Harms, W 2000

Skyrms (2000) describes how evolutionary models are helping us understand unselfish or cooperative behaviour in humans and animals. Mechanisms which can stabilize cooperative behaviour are sensitive to population densities, however. This creates the need for agent-based evolutionary models which depict individual interactions, spatial locations, and stochastic effects. One such model suggests that hostile environments may provide conditions conducive to the emergence and stabilization of cooperative behaviour. In particular, simulations show that random extinctions can keep population densities low, provide ongoing colonization opportunities, and insulate cooperative communities from invasion. Agent-based and population models play complementary roles in furthering our understanding evolutionary processes.

THE 'Hobbesian problem of order'is a fundamental question across the social sciences. The
problem arises because individuals are interdependent yet also autonomous. If there were a
